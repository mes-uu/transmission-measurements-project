## Repository Contents and Structure

The repository is structured according to different components of the instrument. These are

* A small [buoy](buoy/README.md) to carry the testbed, built from readily avalilable materials

* A [carrierplate](carrierplate/README.md) to position the testbed in strategic locations. The testbed is straped to the plate which in turn can be fixated to a stirdy rod or rope

* A [waterproof testbed](testbed/README.md) consisting of

  * A [conotrol and datalogging sytem](testbed/conotrol_and_datalogging_sytem/README.md) based on a Raspberry Pi. It interfaces with multiple independent devices for which it can switch the power and coomunicate via an I2C bus.

  * An [internal mouting system](testbed/internal_mounting_system/README.md) to structure the space inside the testbed

  * (will be added later) Documentation of the tranmsission modules used to test signal quality of different technologies

## Team and Funding
