## Waterproof Case

The case that houses the electronics was chosen for its waterproofness rating IP68, and was found to be at least reasonably permissive to radiosignals in the range of a few 100MHz to a few GHz. It conveniently features a transparent cover. More info and documentation can be found in the files ['info_waterproof_case.pdf'](info_waterproof_case.pdf) and 
['blueprint_waterproof_case.pdf'](blueprint_waterproof_case.pdf) .
